# IMDb Movie Recommendation System
A hybrid Movie Recommendation System using K-Means clustering and content-based filtering (TF-IDF & cosine similarity) to suggest movies similar to a given input.

## Overview
Finding a great movie to watch can be overwhelming. This project builds a smart recommendation system that suggests movies based on their genres, content, and clustering.

## Features
✔ Hybrid Recommendation Approach – Uses clustering and content similarity for better suggestions. 
✔ K-Means Clustering – Groups movies based on feature similarities. 
✔ TF-IDF & Cosine Similarity – Improves accuracy by analyzing movie descriptions. 
✔ Scalable Model – Works with large datasets efficiently.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the IMDb Top 5000 Movies, containing essential movie metadata such as: 
- Title (primaryTitle)
- Year of Release (startYear)
- Ratings & Votes (averageRating, numVotes)
- Genres (genre_list)
- Crew Information (directors, writers)

## Methodology
### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
- Extracted genres & crew information
- Normalized numerical values using MinMaxScaler
- Prepared text features for TF-IDF vectorization

### 2️⃣ K-Means Clustering
- Movies grouped into clusters based on features
- Cluster assignment used for filtering recommendations

### 3️⃣ Content-Based Filtering
- TF-IDF used to vectorize text-based metadata
- Cosine similarity computed for finding similar movies

## Installation & Usage
### Setup
1. Install dependencies:
```python
pip install pandas numpy sklearn matplotlib seaborn
```
2. Run Jupyter Notebook or Python script.

## Usage
```python
# Example: Recommend movies similar to "Ice Age"
recommended_movies_df = recommend_movies("Ice Age", n=5)
print(recommended_movies_df)
```
## Results
The system provides personalized movie recommendations by combining clustering (grouping similar movies) and content analysis (plot + genre matching).

## Outcomes and Learnings
- Gained hands-on experience with unsupervised learning algorithms
- Practiced feature extraction, text vectorization, and similarity computations
- Understood the pipeline of building a real-world recommendation engine
- Applied industry tools like Scikit-learn and CountVectorizer in a practical scenario

## Future Improvements
- Include actor-based filtering
- Enhance recommendations using collaborative filtering
- Use deep learning for better accuracy
